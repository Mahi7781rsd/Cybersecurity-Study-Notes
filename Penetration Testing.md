# Tasks in Penetration Testing

Penetration testing includes various tasks, such as:

- **Reconnaissance** – Gathering information about the target.
  
- **Vulnerability Assessment** – Identifying weaknesses in systems.  
- **Exploitation** – Attempting to break into the system using found vulnerabilities.  
- **Post-exploitation** – Assessing the impact of the breach and maintaining access.  
- **Reporting** – Documenting findings and suggesting fixes.
