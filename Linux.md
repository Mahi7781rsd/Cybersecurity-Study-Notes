# **Linux**  

## **What is Linux?**  
Linux is an **open-source, Unix-like** operating system (OS) that powers everything from servers and smartphones to embedded systems. It is known for its **stability, security, and flexibility**.  

### **Who Created Linux & Why?**  
- **Creator**: **Linus Torvalds** (1991).  
- **Why?**: He wanted a free, **customizable** OS since **Unix was expensive**.

## **Is Linux an OS? No, It's a Kernel!**  

Many people think Linux is an OS, but it's actually a **kernel**.  

### **What’s the Difference?**  
- **Linux = Kernel** → Manages hardware, memory, and processes.  
- **GNU/Linux = Full OS** → Linux + software tools (shell, compilers, libraries, etc.).  

### **Why Do People Call Linux an OS?**  
- In everyday use, people say "Linux" when they actually mean **GNU/Linux** (the full OS).  
- **Linux distributions** like **Ubuntu, Debian, and Arch** package Linux with utilities, making it a complete OS.

## **What is a Distro (Linux Distribution)?**  

A **Linux distribution (distro)** is a **complete operating system** that packages the **Linux kernel** with essential software, system utilities, and a package manager.  

### **Why Are Distros Needed?**  

The **Linux kernel alone is not usable** for general users. Distros add:  

- **Shell & Terminal** – Command-line interface (e.g., Bash, Zsh).
  
- **System Utilities** – Basic tools (`ls`, `cp`, `rm`).  
- **Software Package Manager** – Installs apps (`apt`, `dnf`, `pacman`).  
- **Graphical Interface (Optional)** – Desktop environments (GNOME, KDE).  

### **Examples of Linux Distros**  

1. **Ubuntu** – Beginner-friendly.
   
2. **Debian** – Stable & reliable.  
3. **Arch Linux** – Minimal & customizable.  
4. **Fedora** – Cutting-edge software.  
5. **Kali Linux** – Cybersecurity & penetration testing.
