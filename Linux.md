## Is Linux an OS? No, It's a Kernel!  

Many people think Linux is an OS, but it's actually a **kernel**.  

### **What’s the Difference?**  
- **Linux = Kernel** → Manages hardware, memory, and processes.  
- **GNU/Linux = Full OS** → Linux + software tools (shell, compilers, libraries, etc.).  

### **Why Do People Call Linux an OS?**  
- In everyday use, people say "Linux" when they actually mean **GNU/Linux** (the full OS).  
- **Linux distributions** like **Ubuntu, Debian, Arch** package Linux with utilities, making it a complete OS.
