### What are Logs?

Logs are records that capture events, actions, or messages generated by the system or applications. In the context of Unix/Linux systems, logs are useful for troubleshooting, monitoring, and security auditing. They provide detailed information about system activities, user actions, errors, and more.

### Types of Logs in Unix/Linux

Unix/Linux systems generate various types of log files, each serving a specific purpose. Some common logs are:

1. **System Logs**: These logs provide details about the overall health of the system, like hardware status or operating system events.
2. **Authentication Logs**: These logs contain information about system authentication events, such as user logins, logouts, and attempts to access secured resources.
3. **Application Logs**: Logs generated by applications to capture their activity, errors, and statuses.
